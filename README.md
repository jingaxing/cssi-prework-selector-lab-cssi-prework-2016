# jQuery Selectors Lab

## Objectives
+ Write jQuery selectors to select different HTML elements

## Getting Started
You have stumbled upon an HTML site written by a middle school girl from the early 2000's. This is a perfect testing ground for your jQuery skills. 

In js/selectors.js write the code necessary to select 5 different elements from the index.html page. There are tests to keep you on track!

## Instructions

1. Write a function, `h1Selector`,  that selects all `<h1>` elements and returns them using an element selector.
2. Write a function, `liInOlSelector`,  that selects and returns all `<li>` inside of `<ol>` using a descendant selector.
3. Write a function, `linkSelector`,  that selects and returns the `<a>` that is inside of the element that has both an id of my-id and a class of my-class.
4. Write a function, `catSelector`,  that selects and returns the image of the cat that has the alt text equal to "cat sleeping".
5. Write a function, `checkboxInputSelector`,  that selects and returns all the checkbox inputs
